## Remarks

I'll be adding anything and everything unchecked and/or uncomprehended related to my learnings to this repository from now on. Following the kind suggestions I've received from a few people via Twitter, for the first time in my life (actually), I'll be commenting on my code in Engrish hoping some fellow developers will share their coding journeys with me. Let us learn from each other! (Well, usually I'm the stupid one. So, I'll be learning from you, mostly! üòã)

## A little about me

I may act and sound like a developer, but I consider myself more like a businessperson, currently administrating/helping a few businesses in Europe and my home country Japan interacting with customers from dozens of countries (which should make the businesses "global," technically). I've lived for nearly a decade in Europe before the pandemic. That's where I gained a lot of weight as the meat was delicious üò´ Now, due to a number of factors, one of which is my daughter comfortably going to a kindergarten here, we (my family) live in Japan. Eventually, we'll go back to Europe and we are deciding when.

My primary goal as an occasional developer is to first complete Nekote, which means "cat's paw" in Japanese and is a C# class library that does just the things my following projects will require:

1. A multilingual groupware kind of thing that should help the businesses' internal communication (involving 3 nationalities and 4 languages)
2. A super simple CMS framework that doesnt do much more than organizing pages, files, etc
3. A "smart" product database that automatically learns about our target markets, customers, etc for a lot of naughty things (such as better knowing what kinds of products are attractive to which countries and regions, optimizing our marketing campaigns, better responding to our customers' needs, offering more sophisticated customer support and so on)
4. A CRM thing that is again multilingual and is nicely integrated to #3
5. A very high-tech app that adds the Hidden | System attributes to my extraordinarily private files that must be hidden from my wife

#2 may sound like I'm going to invent the wheel again and I'm pretty sure that's correct, but it'd be significantly more troublesome to develop and integrate #3 to an existing CMS (by following all the rules and conditions) than developing #3 freely and then integrating it to #2, which shouldnt be a big deal.

Also, if #2 is extensible in the ways I'd like it to be, it'll be a good start for a number of weekend projects.

Like I would like to learn Chinese. Japanese people already know 2,500 kanji and some say they use 4,000. Many look similar and share similar meanings (like our "letter" in kanji means "toilet paper" in Chinese, but you'd anyway grab a letter or two if you need to go to the bathroom urgently). So, one day, I'd like to write a web-app that automatically refers to databases offered by the Unicode organization and some others to help me focuses on the differences I dont yet know (so that I wont be learning what I already know). A weekend project like this should be greatly helped by #2.

For now, I wont talk too much about any of the projects above or the businesses I'm related to because I anyway dont have Nekote ready and I anyway dont know enough to help others as a developer; if you have business-related concerns, ideas, etc, it's highly likely that I can be of some help, but this is GitHub and I'd like to first blend in as a developer.

## Say hello

It would be my pleasure to get to know new people. Regardless of if you have just started learning something or have already developed something enormous, say hello and let us know we coexist. Please add a few lines about yourself. Life is too short to think you already know everybody you need!
